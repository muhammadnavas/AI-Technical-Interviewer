      "answer": "Thank you! I'm Priya Sharma, a B.Tech Computer Science student graduating in May 2026 from Mumbai University with an 8.5 CGPA. I've built five projects using technologies like React, Node.js, MongoDB, and Firebase. I'm passionate about frontend development and creating user-friendly web applications.",

    },
    {
      "question": "That's impressive! Can you tell me more about your e-commerce project? What technologies did you use and what challenges did you face?",
      "answer": "For my e-commerce project, I used React for the frontend with Tailwind CSS for styling. I implemented features such as shopping cart functionality, product filtering by category and price, a checkout process, and a dark mode toggle. The main challenge was managing cart state across different components, which I solved using React Context API. I also used local storage to persist the cart data so users don't lose items when they refresh the page.",

      "refinementNotes": "Improved list structure and grammar ('features such as' instead of 'features like')"
    },
    {
      "question": "Great solution! You mentioned using React hooks in your projects. Can you explain how useState and useEffect hooks work?",
      "answer": "useState is a hook that allows you to add state to functional components. It returns an array with the current state value and a function to update it. For example, 'const [count, setCount] = useState(0)' creates a state variable 'count' initialized to 0. useEffect is used for side effects such as fetching data, subscriptions, or manually changing the DOM. It runs after every render by default, but you can control when it runs using the dependency array. In my weather dashboard, I used useEffect to call the OpenWeather API when the component mounted.",

      "refinementNotes": "Enhanced professional tone and added proper code formatting quotes"
    },
    {
      "question": "Excellent explanation! Now, what is the difference between let, const, and var in JavaScript?",
      "answer": "The main differences are scope and reassignment capability. 'var' is function-scoped and can be hoisted, which can lead to bugs. In contrast, 'let' and 'const' are block-scoped and provide better control. 'let' allows reassignment while 'const' creates a constant reference that cannot be reassigned. However, with 'const', you can still modify object properties or array elements. I prefer using 'const' by default and 'let' only when I need to reassign the variable. I avoid 'var' entirely in modern JavaScript.",

      "refinementNotes": "Improved sentence flow and clarity"
    },
    {
      "question": "Perfect! Tell me about your most complex project - the chat application. How did you implement real-time messaging?",
      "answer": "The chat application was definitely my most complex project. I used Firebase Realtime Database, which automatically syncs data across all connected clients. When a user sends a message, I use the Firebase 'push()' method to add it to the database. All clients listening to that chat room receive the update instantly through Firebase's built-in listeners. I implemented user authentication with Firebase Auth, created multiple chat rooms, and added features like online/offline status using Firebase presence detection. The most challenging part was handling race conditions and ensuring messages appear in the correct chronological order.",

      "refinementNotes": "Added clarifying details and improved technical precision"
    },
    {
      "question": "Impressive work! What is the difference between SQL and NoSQL databases, and when would you use each?",
      "answer": "SQL databases like PostgreSQL use structured tables with predefined schemas and relationships. They're excellent for complex queries and transactions, such as in banking applications. NoSQL databases like MongoDB use flexible document structures, which is what I used in my task management app. MongoDB was perfect because task objects could have varying fields. SQL is better when you need ACID transactions and complex joins, while NoSQL excels at scalability, flexibility, and handling unstructured data. I would use SQL for e-commerce orders and NoSQL for social media posts.",

      "refinementNotes": "Enhanced professional vocabulary and grammatical structure"
    },
    {
      "question": "Great comparison! How does Git version control help in software development?",
      "answer": "Git is essential for tracking changes in code. It allows you to create branches to work on features independently without affecting the main codebase. You can commit changes with descriptive messages, making it easy to track what was changed and why. If something breaks, you can revert to a previous working version. Git also enables collaboration—multiple developers can work on the same project, and Git merges their changes. I use Git for all my projects, creating feature branches, making regular commits, and using pull requests to review code before merging.",

      "refinementNotes": "Improved professional tone and punctuation (em dash)"
    },
    {
      "question": "Excellent! Final question: What are the key differences between REST APIs and GraphQL?",
      "answer": "REST APIs have multiple endpoints for different resources, such as /users, /posts, and /comments. Each endpoint returns fixed data structures, which can lead to over-fetching or under-fetching. GraphQL uses a single endpoint and allows clients to request exactly what they need using queries. With GraphQL, you can fetch related data in one request, whereas REST might require multiple requests. REST is simpler to implement and cache, which is why I used it in my projects. GraphQL is better suited for complex applications with varying data requirements. I'm planning to learn GraphQL next for my upcoming projects.",
